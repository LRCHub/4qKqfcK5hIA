[00:11.38] In the morning, woke up from sexual pleasures
[00:13.80] Looked at her sexual partner
[00:16.28] Who acquainted her acquaintance
[00:18.28] Five hours ago at a disco
[00:20.55] She went lower than low, into limbo
[00:22.64] A thought crossed the mind, her, a bimbo
[00:24.89] She answered no, so she had to go...
[00:27.54] On with the program
[00:29.21] Creedence, it seems that I've forgotten your name
[00:31.49] But it seems that she's done the same
[00:33.65] And now something has happened
[00:35.52] Suddenly, she's been distracted
[00:38.02] By something that has been attracted
[00:40.24] She poked and poked and smacked at it
[00:42.48] Then she broke down and she scratched it
[00:44.64] Now, I think you understand
[00:46.88] Clinic, saw the doctor flex his biceps
[00:48.74] Then he picked up a pair of forceps
[00:51.44] Her pretty face showed fright
[00:53.39] Right then and there, she fainted
[00:55.69] A really grim picture is painted
[00:57.85] The brotha who she acquainted
