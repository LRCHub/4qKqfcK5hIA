Come on it's not so bad
Think of all the good times we had
But just like that
The mind has made an enemy
Of a friend

You know how I get so scared
I want what's mine
And I don't want to share
Not with you
Not even if that's what's fair
In the end

Wait a minute
I'm gonna wise up
Gonna rise up to the occasion
Don't turn away
I was just facing my demons

Spent all last year thinkin' about myself
Paid no mind to her failing health
Or asked how you felt
Without my own little angle
In my heart

What a shame
What you see in hindsight
Wish I saw it then instead of tonight
Where the pain of what I just could not get right
Is where I
Gotta start

Wait a minute
I'm
Gonna wise up
Gonna rise up to the occasion
Don't turn away I was just facing my demons
Wait a minute I'm gonna wise up
Gonna rise up
To the occasion
Don't turn away
I was just facing
My demons
